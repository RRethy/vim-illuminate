INTRODUCTION                                                     *illuminate*
=============================================================================

This plugin is a tool for illuminating the other uses of the current word
under the cursor.

|illuminate| will by default highlight all uses of the word under the cursor,
but will a little bit of configuration it can easily only highlight what you
want it to highlight based on the filetype and highlight-groups.

|illuminate| will also do a few other niceties such as delaying the highlight
for a user-defined amount of time based on `g:Illuminate_delay` (by default
250), it will interact nicely with search highlighting, jumping around
between buffers, jumping around between windows, and won't illuminate
while in insert mode.


CONFIGURATION                                      *illuminate-configuration*
=============================================================================

|illuminate| will delay before highlighting, this is not lag, it is to avoid
the jarring experience of things illuminating too fast. This can be
controlled with `g:Illuminate_delay` (which is default to 250 milliseconds):
>
    " Time in millis (default 250)
    let g:Illuminate_delay = 250

By default |illuminate| will highlight all words the cursor passes over, but
for many languages, you will only want to highlight certain |highlight-groups|
(you can determine the highlight-group of a symbol under your cursor with
`:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(synID(line("."), col("."), 1)), "name")`).

You can define which highlight groups you want the illuminating to apply to.
This can be done with a dict mapping a filetype to a list of
|highlight-groups| in your vimrc such as:
>
    let g:Illuminate_ftHighlightGroups = {
          \ 'vim': ['vimVar', 'vimString', 'vimLineComment',
          \         'vimFuncName', 'vimFunction', 'vimUserFunc', 'vimFunc']
          \ }


|illuminate| can also be disabled for various |filetypes| using
g:Illuminate_ftblacklist.
>
    let g:Illuminate_ftblacklist = ['nerdtree']


Lastly, by default the highlighting will be done with the |highlight-group|
`cursorline` since that is in my opinion the nicest. But it can be overriden
using the following or something similar (this will under the words):
>
    hi illuminatedWord cterm=underline gui=underline

=============================================================================

Q: I am seeing by default an underline for the matched words

A: The reason for the underline is that the highlighting is done with
   `cursorline` by default, which defaults to an underline. Try this:
>
    :hi link illuminatedWord Visual.

Q: Certain words get highlighted when my cursor is in the whitespace before
   them

A: This is since it will look for the first word adjacent to the cursor.
   The same behaviour can be seen if you try `*` while in the same whitespace
   before the word.
